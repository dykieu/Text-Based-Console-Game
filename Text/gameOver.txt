You hear sudden quakes within the [Gate]... You at the sky and see
it shift from crimson red to the dark night skies of Seoul, Korea.

**You have been unable to stop the {OUTBREAK} of the [Gate]**

	**You get warped outside of the [Gate]!**
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The monsters start pouring out from inside the [Gate]...

And you watch helplessly as Seoul is overrun by monsters

You slowly drop to your knees as you are overcome with despair

As you close your eyes and sob quietly to yourself, you feel an
ominous presence behind you. 

You turn around sharply as the blade of <Demon Lord> Baran glides
smoothly through your neck.

Your head tumbles to the ground and your limp body collapses to the ground.
