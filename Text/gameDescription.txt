Starting 10 years ago...

Mysterious portals to otherworlds called [Gates]
	started to appear all around the world.

These [Gates] connected the monster world with the real world...

At the same time that these [Gate] appeared, 
	select humans started developing powers...

	These humans were called 'hunters'.

These hunters ranged in levels, from E-Rank to S-Rank, 
	and they risked their lives to enter these [Gates].

Through killing monsters within the [Gates], these hunters 
	attempted to save humanity from the possiblity of 
	an {OUTBREAK}, the event where monsters leave the [GATES] and
	enter the real world, wrecking havoc.
