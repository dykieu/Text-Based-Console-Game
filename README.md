# Text-Based-Console-Game
 A C++ text-based game played through a console

### Project Description
> Design and implement a one-play, text-based game where players are able to move through spaces to obtain items and accomplish a goal.

### Project Requirements
- Self-build data structures (no libraries)
- Space class (Represents the space a player is in). Space class must be an abstract class with pure virtual functions and must have 4 Space pointers (left, right, up, down)
- 3 derived Space classes
- Atleast 6 total spaces
- Time limit
- Requires an item to end game

### Implemented Game Features:
- Responsive map created with double-linked lists (Each with 4 pointers for 4 directions)
- Dice-based combat system
- Interactive environments (Multiple rooms with different random events)
- Custom items (Boss room key, armors, weapons)
- Different type of monsters
- Character and monster skill system
- Character progression (leveling) system
